Complete binary tree
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
Ex: Heap
Full binary tree
A full binary tree can be defined as a binary tree in which all the nodes have 0 or two children.
Ex: Segment Tree
In array representation, Unlike Complete Binary Tree, the last level of Full Binary tree may have gaps between nodes. Duppmy values are used in the gaps.The dummy values are never accessed and have no use. This is some wastage of space due to simple array representation.
